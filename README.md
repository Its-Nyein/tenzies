Amazing react project

- map array to Die Component to generate our array of die elements
- Update the array of numbers in state to be
  an array of objects
- flip the property on the object in the array
  that was clicked
- Update the rollDice function to not just roll
  all new dice, but instead to look through the existing dice
  to NOT role any that are being `held
- check the dice array for winning condition by using every() method
- use react-confetti package to render Confetti components
